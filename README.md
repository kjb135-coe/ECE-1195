The objective of this course is to teach the tools and techniques used in the design of large-scale digital systems. The course consists of a series of design projects and labs centered on modern microprocessor design. This design experience is intended to teach you both the context and content of the design process. You will learn to use a set of design tools in a modern commercial design flow. As content, you will explore the design of a modern microprocessor, see the design trade-offs within its implementation, and learn how to evaluate good and bad design choices.
